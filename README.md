#Fibonacci-Sequence-Server

The Fibonacci Sequence Server calculates the number in the Fibonacci sequence based on your input. In order to do this, the ClientFinal file has to connect to a server
socket. Please make sure to run ServerSocketFinal BEFORE running ClientFile in order to establish a connection to the local host.

Have fun calculating.
